        "## 1. Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "This document provides a comprehensive technical overview of the \"Mycelium-Inspired Graph Database Resilience\" project- a novel approach to enhancing robustness, adaptability, and fault tolerance in graph database systems by modeling natural mycelium network principles. The implementation leverages Python with NetworkX for in-memory graph operations and Neo4j for persistent storage, creating a hybrid architecture that combines computational efficiency with data durability.\n",
