## Project Overview

Ever wondered how mushrooms create incredibly resilient networks that survive damage, adapt to change, and efficiently distribute resources? **This project brings those same biological superpowers to graph databases.**

Traditional distributed systems rely on centralized control and static configurations—creating single points of failure and limiting adaptability. But mycelium networks are nature's masters of resilience, self-organization, and intelligent resource distribution.

Our implementation demonstrates a graph database that **thinks like a fungus**: automatically healing from failures, finding optimal paths dynamically, and evolving its structure based on real-world usage patterns.

## The Mycelium Inspiration

Mycelium—the vast underground network of fungal threads—serves as our biological blueprint. These natural networks exhibit four key properties we've translated into computational advantages:

| Biological Principle | Database Implementation |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| **Redundancy** | Multiple backup pathways prevent single-point failures |
| **Decentralization** | No central control—smart behavior emerges locally |
| **Adaptability** | Dynamic growth and rerouting around obstacles |
| **Resource Efficiency** | Gradient-based optimization of data flow |

## Key Features

- **Self-Healing Networks**: Automatically recovers from node/edge failures by redistributing resources and establishing new connections
- **Adaptive Pathfinding**: Discovers multiple redundant routes and optimizes based on real-time network conditions
- **Dynamic Load Balancing**: Intelligent resource distribution that strengthens frequently used pathways
- **Evolutionary Topology**: Network structure adapts and optimizes over time through simulated usage
- **Hybrid Architecture**: Fast NetworkX in-memory operations + persistent Neo4j cloud storage
- **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in resilience metrics and comparative analysis tools

## How It Works

The system is built around two core classes that work together seamlessly:

### MyceliumGraphDatabase Class
Manages the hybrid storage architecture, mirroring operations between:
- **NetworkX Graph**: Lightning-fast in-memory operations for real-time simulations
- **Neo4j Database**: Persistent cloud storage with ACID compliance and scalability

### MyceliumAlgorithms Class  
Contains the bio-inspired intelligence:

```python
# Hyphal Growth Pathfinding - Finds multiple redundant routes
paths = MyceliumAlgorithms.hyphal_growth_pathfinding(graph, "start", "target")

# Nutrient Flow Simulation - Models resource distribution  
MyceliumAlgorithms.nutrient_flow_simulation(graph, sources, sinks)

# Self-Healing Response - Repairs network damage automatically
MyceliumAlgorithms.self_healing_response(graph, damaged_nodes)
```

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Google Colab (Recommended)
**Perfect for exploring without any setup**

1. Click the **"Open in Colab"** badge above
2. Run all cells to see the system in action
3. Optional: Add your Neo4j AuraDB credentials for persistent storage

### Option 2: Local Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mycelium-graph-db.git
cd mycelium-graph-db

# Install dependencies  
pip install networkx neo4j matplotlib numpy pandas seaborn

# Launch the notebook
jupyter notebook mycelium_demo.ipynb
```

### Neo4j Setup (Optional but Recommended)
For the full experience with persistent storage:

1. Create a free [Neo4j AuraDB](https://neo4j.com/cloud/aura/) instance
2. Note your connection URI, username, and password
3. Add credentials to Cell 3.5 in the notebook
4. If no credentials provided, runs in NetworkX-only mode (still fully functional!)

## Notebook Experiments

The interactive notebook guides you through comprehensive demonstrations:

### Core Demonstrations
- **Network Creation & Visualization**: Generate and inspect complex mycelium-like topologies
- **Multi-Path Discovery**: Watch the system find redundant routes between nodes
- **Damage & Recovery**: Simulate failures and observe automatic self-healing
- **Resource Flow Optimization**: See dynamic load balancing in action
- **Topology Evolution**: Networks that grow and optimize over time

### Performance Analysis
- **Resilience Metrics**: Quantitative measurement of network robustness
- **Comparative Benchmarking**: Mycelium networks vs traditional architectures
- **Attack Simulations**: Targeted node failures and recovery analysis
- **Interactive Playground**: Experiment with custom parameters and scenarios

### Performance Benchmarks

Here's what we measured comparing mycelium networks vs. traditional random networks under a **30% random node removal attack**:

| Metric                   | Traditional (Damaged) | Mycelium (Healed) | Advantage (Mycelium)                     |
| :----------------------- | :-------------------- | :---------------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| **Connected Components** | 3                     | 1                 | **Significantly Better** (Full recovery) |
| **LCC Ratio**            | 0.94                  | 1.00              | **Superior Connectivity** (100% of nodes connected) |
| **Avg Path Length**      | 3.12                  | 2.93              | **More Efficient** (Even after healing) |
| **Edges Remaining**      | 50                    | 62                | **More Robust** (More connections preserved/restored) |
| **Healing Time**         | N/A                   | 0.009s            | **Autonomous Recovery** (Extremely fast) |

**Key Takeaways:**
* The **Mycelium-Inspired Network** successfully **regained full connectivity (1 component, 1.00 LCC Ratio)** after a severe 30% node attack, demonstrating its powerful self-healing capabilities.
* In contrast, the **Traditional Random Network** fragmented into **3 components** and lost a portion of its Largest Connected Component (0.94 LCC Ratio), highlighting its vulnerability to failures.
* Even after healing, the Mycelium network maintained an **efficient average path length (2.93)**, outperforming the fragmented traditional network's largest component (3.12).
* The healing process was **remarkably fast (0.009 seconds)**, showcasing the efficiency of the bio-inspired algorithms.
